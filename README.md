### Introduction

Better SMBW is a mod of *New Super Mario Bros. Wii*, this mod is mainly here to help NSMBW runners for practice.

### Changes vs. vanilla NSMBW

For now only the Any% route is done, this include:


- 5-1: Added a propeller mushroom block before the water section for water skip practice (the prop is the brick block after the ice flower)
- 5-3: Replaced some blocks with a propeller mushroom, ideal if you want to practice this level and if you lose your propeller.
- 5-T/F : Added some blocks with propeller for practicing 556/546 cycle.
- 5-4: Added a lot of blocks with propeller for 5-4 skip
- 8-1: Replaced some blocks with a propeller mushroom. Removed meteors. No more RNG during your practice.
- 8-2: Removed meteors for the 1st area. No other changes.
- 8-7: Replaced some blocks with a fire flower (or mushroom if you're small). Even if practicing 8-7 is kinda dumb, I do some changes anyway.
- 8-A: You want to practice Bombless but you don't want to do the whole Airship ? Ok, a pipe is here for you ! This pipe goes directly to the Bowser Jr. fight.
- 8-C: There are a pipe at the begining of Bowser's Castle if you want to practice Bowser's Escape without doing the whole castle.

All Any% levels other changes:

- Added a pipe at the end of all Any% levels, that pipe goes to the begining of the level if you want to practice the level again. That allows the player to avoid to pause the game then "Exit course" and re-enter again.
- Increased the time to 999 for all levels to have more time to practice them. 

### How to play ?

Requirements:

- A Wii or Wii U
- A New Super Mario Bros. Wii disc (region doesn't matter)
- An SD Card or SDHC Card (SDHC is only compatible on Wii, you need a normal SD Card if you're on Wii U)
- Riivolution (an homebrew app to patch Wii games), Here is a tutorial to how to install this app on [Wii](https://newerteam.com/wii/help/ihasnohomebrew.html) , check this one if you're on [Wii U](https://newerteam.com/wii/help/wiiu.html)

Steps:

1) Download the mod at the [releases](https://github.com/R0-main/BetterSMBW/releases) section
2) Extract the zip to the **root** of your SD Card
3) Put your SD card and power on your console with your disc and boot Riivolution (the ways of booting are different depending of the console, check the links above for more info)
4) Put "BetterSMBW" as enabled, if you've other patches, make sure to **disable** them before launching the game !
5) Click on "Launch"
6) That's it !

If at any time you want to play to the original game, just return on the Wii menu or reboot the console to cancel the patch applies. Don't be an idiot by submitting a run on the leaderboards done on that mod OpieOP
