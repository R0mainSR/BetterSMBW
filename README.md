### Introduction

Better SMBW is a mod of *New Super Mario Bros. Wii*, this mod is mainly here to help NSMBW runners for practice.

### Changes vs. vanilla NSMBW

For now only the Any% route is done, this include:

- Removed 8-1 and 8-2 falling meteors. You can now practice these levels without problems due to RNG (especially 8-1)
- You want to practice Bombless but you don't want to do the whole Airship ? Ok, a pipe is here for you ! This pipe go directly to the Bowser Jr. fight.
- There are also a pipe at the begining of Bowser's Castle if you want to practice Bowser's Escape without doing the whole castle.
- Added a pipe at the end of all Any% levels (except 8-C), that pipe go to the begining of the level if you want to practice the level again.
- Increased the time to 999 for all levels to have more time to practice them. That allows the player to avoid to pause the game then "Exit course" and re-enter again.
