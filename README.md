### Introduction

Better SMBW is a mod of *New Super Mario Bros. Wii*, this mod is mainly here to help NSMBW runners for practice.

### Main changes

- No time limit (except 8-2 because of an issue) so you can practice the level as long as you want.
- Added doors at the end of each level (except 8-7) if you want to restart them from the begining without exiting.
- Reset pipe in 8-Airship to reset the Bowser Jr. fight, ideal to practice bombless. Also added a pipe at the start of 8-Airship to go to the Bowser Jr. fight directly without doing the whole level.
- Pipe at the start of 8-Castle so you can start directly to Bowser's escape. Also added a door right before the final switch if you want to redo Bowser's escape.
- Removed the darkness in 6-6 to make the practice of the level easier
- Added a reset music room in 5-4 for 5-4 skip practice. Just enter the door right before the flagpole to get into that room.
- More coming! 

### How to play ?
